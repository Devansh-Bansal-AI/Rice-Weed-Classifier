This image can be changed to a visually appealing project image or a representative screenshot.

üìù Abstract
This project implements a deep learning solution for rice-weed classification using transfer learning with the MobileNetV2 architecture. The system achieved an exceptional test accuracy of 

95.44% on a dataset of 3,632 images across 11 distinct classes. This demonstrates the model's effective performance for precision agriculture applications by successfully distinguishing between rice plants and various weed species.


‚ú® Key Features

High Accuracy: The model shows excellent performance with a final test accuracy of 95.44%.


Efficient Architecture: The MobileNetV2 architecture is efficient and suitable for mobile and embedded devices.


Fast Training: The transfer learning approach significantly reduces the training time while maintaining high accuracy.


Robust Generalization: The model shows stable performance across training epochs and generalizes well to unseen data.



Confident Predictions: The model was able to classify new images with a very high confidence score of 92.21%.
